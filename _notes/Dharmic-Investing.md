Inspired by this [article](https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=6003) on marrying [[Dharma]] with investing money, I wonder if it is possible to analyze companies on their adherence to dharmic principles.

For example, each month, there can be a "stock pick" or "company pick" where I evaluate a winning dharmic company based on multiple factors.

I would use Airtable to categorize and structure the data. Although if this is a paid newsletter format, then a Substack publication would also work. I would provide an in-depth guidance on how a great company in unique industries and niches exist and how they are aligned with dharmic principles, how they align with others in the industry and how their performance stacks up with the rest of S&P 500 index (or whatever category or market they belong to).

**Goal:** To create a database and index of Dharmic companies and prove to people that it can beat the market. That 1+ billion people who belong to Dharmic traditions can invest with their beliefs at the heart of it.

I do not have to break down the categories itself every time. Dharma is dynamic and it changes with the context of each company. Therefore, for Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods, the categories look very different than a technology company and how it operates.

You can pick companies from social investing indices and then use that as a jumping off point to add an extra layer of analysis.

**Categories:** This might include the following
- Ahimsa or non-violence. Does the company contribute to violence towards animals or humans or slave-like conditions?
- Asteya. Does this company rely on excessive debt?
- Dhairya. Does this company run for the long term or is it excessively short term focused?
- Community service. Does this company build the company it operates in?
- Balance. Does the company restore the resources it uses (e.g. Nestle does not do this with the water it extracts AFAIK, therefore it would not be a perfect match)?

**Blocks:**
- How would you even rank a company on these factors?
- It's kind of daunting to even figure out which companies to pick, and where to find the company.
- The idea of poring over hundreds of analyst reports and doing finance-y things does not sound appealing. Although, you are not doing ratio analysis.
- Unclear about how to rank companies. Compared to others in the industry (that would mean knowing everything about the industry) or absolute? -- Absolute makes the most sense.
- What if it doesn't perform as well as others?
- There are other social index funds which capture this pretty well.

**Next Steps might be:**
- Look at existing social investing indices and use that as a jumping off point.
