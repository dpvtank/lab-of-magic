## Dharmic Investing

Inspired by this [article](https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=6003) on marrying [[Dharma]] with investing money, I wonder if it is possible to analyze companies on their adherence to dharmic principles.

For example, each month, there can be a "stock pick" or "company pick" where I evaluate a winning dharmic company based on multiple factors.

I would use Airtable to categorize and structure the data. Although if this is a paid newsletter format, then a Substack publication would also work. I would provide an in-depth guidance on how a great company in unique industries and niches exist and how they are aligned with dharmic principles, how they align with others in the industry and how their performance stacks up with the rest of S&P 500 index (or whatever category or market they belong to).

**Goal:** To create a database and index of Dharmic companies and prove to people that it can beat the market. That 1+ billion people who belong to Dharmic traditions can invest with their beliefs at the heart of it.

**Categories:** This might include the following
- Ahimsa or non-violence. Does the company contribute to violence towards animals or humans or slave-like conditions?
- Asteya. Does this company rely on excessive debt?
- Dhairya. Does this company run for the long term or is it excessively short term focused?
- Community service. Does this company build the company it operates in?
- ??? - what else might go here?

Unknowns:
- How would you even rank a company on these factors?
